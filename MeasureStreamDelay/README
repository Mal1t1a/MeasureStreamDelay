* Measure Stream Delay by Mal1t1a *
* ------------------------------- *
* This application was created to *
* measure the visual delay in the *
* Client -> Server -> Server ->   *
* Client(s) system which is found *
* in most streaming websites.     *
* ------------------------------- *
* This uses visual cues to record *
* and measure the delay from your *
* stream. During this test, the   *
* program will flash several      *
* colours on your GUI which is    *
* going to appear on your stream. *
